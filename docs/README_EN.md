## 🎯 Getting Started

This repo follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and works with any compatible agent.

### Option A: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

The fastest way to install. Requires Claude Code v1.0.33+.

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace add agiprolabs/claude-trading-skills
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**

```
/plugin install trading-skills@agiprolabs-claude-trading-skills
```

**That's it!** All 67 skills are now available. Claude will automatically discover and use them when relevant to your trading tasks. Skills are namespaced as `/trading-skills:skill-name`.

**Managing the plugin:**

```
/plugin                                                    # Browse installed plugins
/plugin disable trading-skills@agiprolabs-claude-trading-skills   # Disable
/plugin enable trading-skills@agiprolabs-claude-trading-skills    # Re-enable
/plugin uninstall trading-skills@agiprolabs-claude-trading-skills # Remove

## 💡 Quick Examples

### 🔍 Token Deep Dive

```
Use available skills. Analyze this Solana token: [MINT_ADDRESS]. Get current price and volume 
from Birdeye, check holder distribution and top 10 concentration, analyze liquidity depth across 
DEX pools, compute RSI/MACD/BBands on 1h candles, estimate slippage for a 0.5 SOL entry, and 
give me a risk assessment with suggested position size assuming 2% portfolio risk.
```

**Skills Used**: birdeye-api, token-holder-analysis, liquidity-analysis, dex-pool-analysis, pandas-ta, slippage-modeling, risk-management, position-sizing

### 📊 Strategy Backtest

```
Use available skills. Backtest a simple RSI mean-reversion strategy on SOL/USDC 1h candles for 
the past 6 months. Entry when RSI(14) < 30, exit when RSI > 70. Use 1% risk per trade with 
ATR(14)*2 stop loss. Show me equity curve, drawdown chart, and key metrics (Sharpe, max DD, 
win rate, profit factor).
```

**Skills Used**: birdeye-api, ohlcv-processing, pandas-ta, vectorbt, portfolio-analytics, trading-visualization

### 🏦 DeFi Yield Comparison

```
Use available skills. Compare yield opportunities for SOL across Raydium, Orca, and Meteora 
LP pools. Calculate impermanent loss at ±25% and ±50% price moves. Show me net APY after IL 
for each pool, and rank them by risk-adjusted yield. Include MEV risk assessment.
```

**Skills Used**: defillama-api, dex-pool-analysis, lp-math, impermanent-loss, yield-analysis, mev-analysis, trading-visualization

### 🐋 Whale Monitoring

```
Use available skills. Analyze the top 20 holders of [TOKEN_MINT]. Identify which wallets have 
been accumulating in the past 7 days. Check if any are known profitable traders. Show me the 
holder distribution with a Gini coefficient and flag any concentration risks.
```

**Skills Used**: helius-api, token-holder-analysis, whale-tracking, solana-onchain, trading-visualization

### 🧾 Tax-Aware Position Management

```
Use available skills. I'm tracking cost basis for my SOL trades using proportional (average)
cost basis for my accumulate/house-money strategy. I bought 10 SOL at $150, then 5 SOL at $180.
Now I want to sell 3 SOL at $200. Calculate my cost basis, realized gain, and remaining position.
Then check if any of my recent sells trigger wash sale rules, and show me what my Form 8949
entries would look like. Export the results in Koinly-compatible format.
```

**Skills Used**: cost-basis-engine, tax-liability-tracking, wash-sale-detection, crypto-tax-export, regulatory-reporting

### 🤖 ML Signal Pipeline

```
Use available skills. Build a feature set for [TOKEN] using 1h OHLCV data: RSI, MACD, 
Bollinger Band width, volume ratio, and holder count momentum. Train an XGBoost classifier 
to predict >2% returns in the next 4 hours. Use walk-forward validation with 30-day train, 
7-day test windows. Show feature importance and classification metrics.
```

**Skills Used**: birdeye-api, ohlcv-processing, pandas-ta, custom-indicators, feature-engineering, signal-classification, trading-visualization

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Skills not loading**
- Verify skill folders are in the correct directory (see [Getting Started](#-getting-started))
- Each skill folder must contain a `SKILL.md` file
- Restart your agent/IDE after copying skills
- For plugin installs: run `/plugin` to check status, try `/reload-plugins`

**Problem: Missing Python dependencies**
- Check the specific `SKILL.md` file for required packages
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install package-name`

**Problem: API rate limits**
- Free tiers have rate limits — review the specific API documentation
- Consider implementing caching or batch requests
- Upgrade to pro tiers for heavy usage

**Problem: API key errors**
- Store keys in environment variables, not in code
- Check the skill's `SKILL.md` for authentication setup
- Verify your credentials and permissions

**Problem: Scripts failing**
- Most scripts support `--demo` mode for testing without API keys
- Check the script's docstring for required environment variables
- Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed

## ❓ FAQ

### General

**Q: Is this free to use?**
A: Yes, MIT licensed. Individual skills may reference tools with their own licensing.

**Q: Can I use this for live trading?**
A: The execution skills (dex-execution, raptor-dex) can interact with real markets, but they default to simulation/demo mode and require explicit confirmation. Use at your own risk.

**Q: Why crypto/DeFi first?**
A: The tooling gap is largest in crypto/DeFi. The extensible structure means contributors can add equities, options, and futures skills following the exact same pattern.

**Q: Does this work with tools other than Claude Code?**
A: Yes. Skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and work with 30+ compatible tools including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Roo Code, Goose, and more.

**Q: Why are all skills bundled together instead of separate packages?**
A: Trading is inherently cross-disciplinary. Bundling all skills together makes it easy to chain workflows — e.g., fetching data, computing indicators, backtesting, sizing positions, and exporting tax reports — without worrying about which individual skills to install.

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Do I need all API keys?**
A: No. Many skills (DexScreener, DeFiLlama, Jupiter quotes, CoinGecko free tier) need no authentication. Only install API keys for the services you use.

**Q: Do I need all Python packages installed?**
A: No. Only install the packages you need. Each skill specifies its requirements in its `SKILL.md` file.

**Q: What if a skill doesn't work?**
A: First check the [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) section. If the issue persists, [open an issue](https://github.com/agiprolabs/claude-trading-skills/issues) with detailed reproduction steps.

### Contributing

**Q: Can I contribute my own skills?**
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See [Contributing](#-contributing) for guidelines.

**Q: How do I report bugs or suggest features?**
A: [Open an issue](https://github.com/agiprolabs/claude-trading-skills/issues) with a clear description. For bugs, include reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
